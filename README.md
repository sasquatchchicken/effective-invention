# Flipper Ducky Payload: Privilege Escalation via PsExec on Windows 11

## Description   [Demonstration video on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@_toksa/video/7419417474929560878)
This Flipper Ducky payload script is designed to escalate privileges on a Windows 11 machine using PsExec to impersonate the winlogon.exe process. It automates the download of PsExec from a Python server and then copies it to C:\Windows\System32. Using PsExec, it impersonates winlogon.exe, which runs with SYSTEM privileges. Finally, it creates a new administrative user on the target machine.
This payload takes advantage of administrative access to create a new user with administrative privileges and is intended for ethical testing only.

## Impact
The impact of this script is the escalation of privileges on a Windows 11 target. After execution, the attacker gains the ability to:

Impersonate SYSTEM-level processes (via the winlogon.exe token).

Create new admin accounts on the machine without the user’s knowledge.

Potentially perform other privileged actions using the new administrative account.

This technique relies on the following:

**PsExec:** A tool from Sysinternals that allows users to run processes on a remote machine or impersonate another user on the local machine.

**Token Impersonation:** The ability to use winlogon.exe's SYSTEM token to execute commands with elevated privileges.
## Warning: This script should only be used in ethical security research and controlled environments with explicit permission from the owner of the device. Misuse of this payload can result in unauthorized access and violation of privacy, which is illegal.
## Impact on Security and Modern Defenses
This payload demonstrates the power of automating privilege escalation using PowerShell and PsExec in Windows environments. It highlights several security concerns:

**Administrative Privileges:** The script assumes administrative access to open PowerShell in an elevated mode and bypass UAC. Without such privileges, this attack would be limited.

**Token Impersonation:** By using PsExec to impersonate winlogon.exe, the attacker can execute commands as SYSTEM, gaining the highest level of privileges on the machine.

**Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Modern EDR systems and antivirus solutions may detect and block this script due to its reliance on PowerShell and PsExec, both commonly associated with malicious activity. However, attackers could modify the payload to bypass basic detection mechanisms.

**Credential Stealing:** With admin privileges, further attacks such as credential dumping, password extraction, and persistence mechanisms can be executed, allowing the attacker long-term access to the system.
